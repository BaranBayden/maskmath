    <p>It’s increasingly evident that masks have an outsized effect on curbing the spread of COVID-19. But how effective are masks <i>exactly</i>? There’s a massive (and unfortunately highly politicized) debate on this topic, with lots of people loudly offering differing opinions.</p>

    <p>In this article, we’ll use high-school level math to develop our intuition for how masks reduce the spread of airborne diseases like COVID-19. After reading this, you'll be able to quantitatively predict how wearing masks influences an epidemic.</p>

    <p>For example, you'll see how when 60% of people wear 60% effective masks, the overall rate of disease transmission will fall by 60 percent, which is more or less what we need to halt the spread of COVID-19. So the next time that you get into an argument about masks, rather than argue about <i>opinions</i>, you can argue about <i>numbers</i> instead.</p>

    <h2>Say it, Don't Spray It</h2>

    <p>First, let’s get a ballpark sense for some numbers. Whenever we exhale, we spray out particles of saliva of various tiny sizes. When a person is contagious, this 'mouth spray' is packed with viral particles, and this virus-laden saliva spray is the primary way that COVID-19 spreads.</p>

    <p>When a contagious person breathes, they spray out roughly <b>a thousand</b> viral particles every minute.</p>

    <p>When they talk, they spray out roughly <b>ten thousand</b> viral particles every minute.</p>

    <p>When they cough, they spray out roughly <b>a hundred thousand</b> viral particles.</p>

    <p>And when they sneeze, they spray out roughly <b>a million</b> viral particles.</p>

    <p>The more viral particles travel from person to person, the higher the chance of infection.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="false" :mask2="false">Scenario 1: When a contagious person is in close contact with a suceptible person, virus-laden particles of saliva can transmit disease.</maskanim>

  <div class="container">

    <p>Masks reduce the amount of mouth spray that travels from a contagious person to a susceptible person by blocking or redirecting the spray, which in turn reduces the number of viral particles transmitted.</p>

    <p>It's worth keeping in mind that no mask is perfect. Even the N95 masks recommend for use by health workers are only guaranteed to block 95% of the hardest-to-block incoming particles (and that’s only if you wear it right).</p>

    <p>Masks don't guarantee safety, they reduce risk. This is just like how umbrellas can't guarantee that you'll stay dry, but they do reduce your odds of getting drenched.</p>

    <p>So let’s imagine that a contagious person wears a 50% effective mask. This means that out of every 100 viral particles that the person would transmit without a mask, 50 are blocked or redirected by the mask. In other words, a 50% effective mask blocks 50% of viral particles.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="true" :mask2="false">Scenario 2: If the contagious person wears a 50% effective mask, the chance of disease transmission is reduced by 50%.</maskanim>

  <div class="container">

    <p>But what if the susceptible person wears the mask instead of the contagious person?</p>

    <p>In general, the effectiveness of a mask varies depending on whether you’re <b>inhaling</b> or <b>exhaling</b> through it. But for now, let’s keep things simple and assume that this mask is equally effective in both directions, i.e. it blocks 50% of viral particles whether you exhale or inhale through it.</p>

    <p>So when the susceptible person wears a mask, we’ll still see a 50% drop in viral particles transmitted.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="false" :mask2="true">Scenario 3: If the susceptible person wears a 50% effective mask, the chance of disease transmission is also reduced by 50%.</maskanim>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>So far, this is just what we expect. But here’s a surprise. What if both the contagious and the susceptible person wear a mask?</p> 

    <p>In this case, the first mask blocks half the viral particles, and the second mask blocks half of the remaining particles. This means that only a quarter of viral particles make it through both masks, which amounts to a 75% reduction in viral particles.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="true" :mask2="true">Scenario 4: When both people wear 50% effective masks, the chance of disease transmission is reduced by 75%.</maskanim>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>That's surprising, because if everybody wore a half-effective mask, then it <i>feels like</i> this should at best only be half-effective at curbing the spread of disease. But that's wrong! If everyone wore a 50% effective mask, virus transmission would drop by 75 percent – not 50 percent.</p>

    <p>That’s because in this scenario, masks filter the spray twice: once on the way out, and a second time on the way in. This <b>double protection</b> is the reason that masks are more effective than they might seem.</p>

    <p>Below, we've listed all four possible contact scenarios through which an airborne disease can spread. In the case where neither person is wearing a mask, there’s no reduction in virus transmission, since masks only work if you wear them.</p>

    <h2>From People to The Population</h2>

    <p>So far we've been looking at virus transmission in the context of individual person-to-person contacts. But we can use these numbers to calculate the reduction in virus transmission for <i>the entire population</i>.</p>

    <p>To do this, we need to know how likely each scenario is, which depends on how many people wear a mask. For example, if nobody wore a mask, we’d only have the first scenario to consider, and so virus transmission in the population would be unaffected.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    <div class="rows">
      <tablelabel text1="Likelihood" text2="Contact Scenario" text3="Particles Blocked"></tablelabel>
      <maskscenario :mask1="false" :mask2="false" text1="100%" text2="0%"></maskscenario>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
      If no one wore a mask, virus transmission would be unaffected.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container">

    <p>Conversely, if everybody wore a 50% effective mask, then we’d only have the last scenario to consider, and so virus transmission in the population would drop by 75 percent.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    <div class="rows">
      <tablelabel text1="Likelihood" text2="Contact Scenario" text3="Particles Blocked"></tablelabel>
      <maskscenario :mask1="true" :mask2="true" text1="100%" text2="75%"></maskscenario>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
      If everyone wore a 50% effective mask, virus transmission would drop by 75%.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container">

    <p>In reality some people wear masks, and others don’t. This means we need to calculate an average across all four scenarios.</p>

    <p>To make things simple for now, let’s assume that 50% of people wear masks, which of course implies that 50% don’t wear masks. When two people meet at random, the odds that neither person is wearing a mask is then 50% times 50%, or 25%.</p>

    <p>Similarly, we can work out the odds for the other three scenarios. It turns out that when half the people in the population are wearing masks, all four scenarios are equally likely.</p>

    <div class="rows">
      <tablelabel text1="Frequency" text2="Contact Scenario" text3="Particles Blocked"></tablelabel>
      <maskscenario :mask1="false" :mask2="false" text1="25%" text2="0%"></maskscenario>
      <maskscenario :mask1="true" :mask2="false" text1="25%" text2="50%"></maskscenario>
      <maskscenario :mask1="false" :mask2="true" text1="25%" text2="50%"></maskscenario>
      <maskscenario :mask1="true" :mask2="true" text1="25%" text2="75%"></maskscenario>

    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>We can now calculate the <b>reduction in virus transmission for the entire population</b>. Since we’ve set things up so that all four scenarios are equally likely, we just need to compute the average of 0%, 50%, 50% and 75%, which is 43.75%.</p>

    <p>We can also calculate the <b>reduction in virus transmission to people who don’t wear masks</b>. They can only get infected via the first two scenarios show above, which are equally likely when half the population is wearing a mask. So the answer is the average of 0% and 50%, which is 25%.</p>

    <p>Similarly, people who DO wear masks can only get infected via the last two scenarios shown above. So <b>the reduction in virus transmission to mask-wearers</b> is the average of 50% and 75%, which is 62.5%.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    <div class="rows">
      <div class="simplerow">Reduction in Virus Transmission for Entire Population = 43.75%</div>
      <div class="simplerow">Reduction in Virus Transmission to Mask Wearers = 25%</div>
      <div class="simplerow">Reduction in Virus Transmission to Non-Mask Wearers = 62.5%</div>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">

  </div>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>Remember, the fewer viral particles you inhale, the less likely you are to become infected (and if you do get infected, inhaling fewer viral particles generally results in less severe symptoms).</p>

    <p>This means that mask wearers get the largest benefit from mask wearing, as you might expect. But even non-mask wearers get a significant (freeloading) benefit! That’s because the air they breathe can be filtered by <i>other people’s</i> partially effective masks.</p>

    <p>The population as a whole, which is made up of both mask wearers and non-mask wearers, gets a benefit somewhere in between these two groups.</p>

    <p>So in this simplified example, we’ve worked out how to go from the <b>protection that a mask offers an <i>individual</i></b> to the <b>collective benefit that masks confer to a <i>society</i>.</b></p>

    <h2>Let's Make it Interactive</h2>

    <p>We can now extend this to any values of mask wearership and mask effectiveness. Let’s add in sliders so you can vary these numbers, so you can see how the percentage of people wearing a mask influences the risk of disease spread.</p>
