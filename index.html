    <p>It’s increasingly evident that masks have an outsized effect on curbing the spread of COVID-19. But how effective are masks exactly? There’s a massive debate on this topic, with lots of people loudly offering differing opinions.</p>

    <p>In this article, we’ll use high-school level math to develop our intuition for how masks reduce the spread of airborne diseases like COVID-19. After reading this, you'll be able to quantitatively understand how wearing masks influences an epidemic. So the next time that you get into an argument about masks, rather than argue about <i>opinions</i>, you can argue about <i>numbers</i> instead.</p>

    <h2>Say it, Don't Spray It</h2>

    <p>First, let’s get a ballpark sense for some numbers. Whenever we exhale, we spray out particles of saliva of various tiny sizes. When a person is contagious, this 'mouth spray' is packed with viral particles, and this virus-laden saliva spray is the primary way that COVID-19 spreads.</p>

    <p>When a contagious person breathes, they spray out roughly <b>a thousand</b> viral particles every minute.</p>

    <p>When they talk, they spray out roughly <b>ten thousand</b> viral particles every minute.</p>

    <p>When they cough, they spray out roughly <b>a hundred thousand</b> viral particles.</p>

    <p>And when they sneeze, they spray out roughly <b>a million</b> viral particles.</p>

    <p>The more viral particles travel from person to person, the higher the risk of infection.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="false" :mask2="false">When a contagious person is in close contact with a suceptible person, virus-laden particles of saliva can transmit disease.</maskanim>

  <div class="container">

    <p>Masks reduce the amount of ‘mouth spray’ that can travel from a contagious person to a susceptible person (either by blocking the spray, or by redirecting the spray so that it’s more diffuse), thereby reducing the number of viral particles transmitted.</p>

    <p>It's worth keeping in mind that no mask is perfect. Even the N95 masks recommend for use by health workers are only guaranteed to block 95% of the incoming particles (and that’s only if you wear it right). So you shouldn't think of masks like impenetrable force fields that guarantee safety, they're more like armor that reduces your risk.</p>

    <p>Let’s imagine that a contagious person is wearing a 50% effective mask. This means that for every hundred viral particles that the person would transmit without a mask, fifty are either blocked or redirected by the mask, while the remaining fifty are still transmitted. So by wearing this mask, the number of viral particles that a contagious person transmits to a susceptible person is cut in half.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="true" :mask2="false">If the contagious person's mask blocks or redirects half of all exhaled viral particles, the risk of disease transmission is cut in half.</maskanim>

  <div class="container">

    <p>What if the susceptible person wears the mask instead of the contagious person?</p>

    <p>In general, the effectiveness of a mask varies depending on whether you’re <b>inhaling</b> or <b>exhaling</b> through it. But for now, let’s keep things simple and assume that this mask is equally effective in both directions, i.e. it filters 50% of viral particles whether you exhale or inhale through it.</p>

    <p>With these assumptions, when the susceptible person is wearing a mask, we’ll still see a 50% reduction in the number of viral particles transmitted.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="false" :mask2="true">If the susceptible person's mask blocks half of all inhaled viral particles, the risk of disease transmission is cut in half.</maskanim>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>So far, this is just what we expect. But here’s where it gets interesting. What if both the contagious and the susceptible person wear a mask?</p> 

    <p>In this case, the first mask blocks half the viral particles, and the second mask blocks half of the remaining particles. This means that only a quarter of viral particles make it through both masks, which amounts to a 75% reduction in viral particles.</p>

  </div>

  <maskanim :mask1="true" :mask2="true">When both people wear 50% effective masks, the risk of disease transmission becomes 25%.</maskanim>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>Here’s why this is unexpected. Suppose everybody wore a 50% effective mask. If everyone does a half-effective thing, it <i>feels like</i> this should only be half-effective overall. So you might guess that a 50% effective mask can at best only reduce transmission by 50 percent. But in this scenario, the virus transmission actually drops by 75 percent!</p>

    <p>That’s because in this scenario, masks filter the spray twice: once on the way out, and a second time on the way in. This double protection is the reason that masks are more effective than they might seem.</p>

    <p>So here’s every possible contact scenario by which an airborne disease can spread from person to person. For completeness, we’ve also included the default case where neither person is wearing a mask (in which case there’s no reduction in virus transmission, since masks only work if you wear them.)</p>

    <h2>From People to The Population</h2>

    <p>So far we've been looking at virus transmission in the context of individual person-to-person contacts. But we can use these numbers to calculate the average reduction in virus transmission for <i>the entire population</i>. To do this, we need to know how likely each scenario is, which depends on how many people wear a mask.</p>

    <p>If nobody wore a mask, then we’d only have the first scenario, and so virus transmission in the population would be unaffected.</p>

    <p>And conversely, if everybody wore a mask, then we’d only have the last scenario, and so virus transmission in the population will drop by 75 percent.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">

  </div>

  <div class="container">

    <p>In reality some people wear masks, and others don’t. This means we need to calculate an average across all scenarios.</p>

    <p>To make things simple for now, let’s assume that 50% of people wear masks, which implies that 50% don’t wear masks. When two people meet at random, the odds that neither person is wearing a mask is then 50% times 50%, or 25%. Similarly, we can work out the odds for the other three scenarios. It turns out that when half the people in the population are wearing masks, all four scenarios are equally likely.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    GRAPHIC
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>We can now calculate the <b>reduction in virus transmission for the entire population</b>. Since we’ve set things up so that all four scenarios are equally likely, we just need to compute the average of 0%, 50%, 50% and 75%, which is 43.75%.</p>

    <p>We can also calculate the <b>reduction in virus transmission to people who don’t wear masks</b>. They can only get infected via the first two scenarios show above, which are equally likely when half the population is wearing a mask. So the answer is the average of 0% and 50%, which is 25%.</p>

    <p>Similarly, people who DO wear masks can only get infected via the last two scenarios shown above. So <b>the reduction in virus transmission to mask-wearers</b> is the average of 50% and 75%, which is 62.5%.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">

  <div class="container">

    <p>Remember, the fewer viral particles you inhale, the less likely you are to become infected (and if you do get infected, inhaling fewer viral particles generally results in less severe symptoms).</p>

    <p>This means that mask wearers get the largest benefit from mask wearing, as you might expect. But even non-mask wearers get a significant (freeloading) benefit! That’s because the air they breathe can be filtered by <i>other people’s</i> partially effective masks. And the population as a whole, which is made up of both mask wearers and non-mask wearers, gets a benefit somewhere in between these two groups.</p>

    <p>So in this simplified example, we’ve worked out how to go from the <b>protection that a mask offers an <i>individual</i></b> to the <b>collective benefit that masks confer to a <i>society</i>.</b></p>

    <h2>Let's Make it Interactive</h2>

    <p>We can now extend this to any values of mask wearership and mask effectiveness. Let’s add in sliders so you can vary these numbers, so you can see how the percentage of people wearing a mask influences the risk of disease spread.</p>
