      We <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620311429">now know</a> that masks have an outsized effect on halting the spread of COVID-19.
      And yet some people are still opposed to wearing masks because they view this as a personal choice rather than as a public health issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      This misses the big picture because masks don't just protect the wearer, they also protect the people around them.
      Your decision on whether or not to wear a mask impacts your society.
    </p>

    <p>In fact, we can actually <i>quantify</i> this impact.</p>

    <p>
      In this interactive essay, we’ll calculate the social benefit of wearing masks (or conversely, the social cost of not wearing masks).
      By doing the math on masks, we'll see how masks can be a surprisingly powerful way to extinguish epidemics.
      For example, we'll calculate that when 60% of people wear masks that are 60% effective, disease transmission will drop by 60% — roughly what's needed to stop the spread of COVID-19.
    </p>

    <h2>Say it, Don't Spray It</h2>

    <p>
      First, let’s get a ballpark sense for some numbers.
      When a person exhales, they spray out saliva particles of various tiny sizes.
      If this person is contagious, then their 'mouth spray' is packed with viral particles.
      This virus-laden saliva spray is the main way that COVID-19 spreads.
    </p>

    <p>When a contagious person breathes, they spray out roughly <b>a thousand</b> viral particles every minute.</p>

    <p>When they talk, they spray out roughly <b>ten thousand</b> viral particles every minute.</p>

    <p>When they cough, they spray out roughly <b>a hundred thousand</b> viral particles.</p>

    <p>And when they sneeze, they spray out roughly <b>a million</b> viral particles.</p>

    <p>
      The more viral particles travel from person to person, the higher the chance of infection.
      (And once infected, people who inhale more viral particles will generally experience more severe symptoms.)
    </p>

  </div>

  <anim-with-caption :mask1="false" :mask2="false"><b>Transmission Route 1:</b> When a contagious person is in close contact with a susceptible person,<br/>virus-laden saliva particles can transmit disease.</anim-with-caption>

  <div class="container">

    <p>Masks reduce the amount of mouth spray that travels from a contagious person to a susceptible person (either by blocking or by redirecting the spray), thereby reducing the risk of infection.</p>

    <p>
      It's worth keeping in mind that no mask is perfect.
      Even the N95 masks recommend for use by health workers are only guaranteed to block <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAdanPfQdCA">95% of the hardest-to-block particles</a> (and that’s only if you wear it right).
    </p>

    <p>
      Masks don't guarantee safety, they reduce risk.
      This is similar to how an umbrella doesn't guarantee that you'll stay dry, but it does reduce your chance of getting wet.
      Like umbrellas, masks only work if you use them correctly.
      But unlike umbrellas, which only protect people who use them, masks also protect people <i>around</i> the wearer.
      Which makes masks more effective than you might expect.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>Why Masks Protect Us Twice</h2>

    <p>
      Let’s imagine that a contagious person wears a 50 percent effective mask.
      By '50 percent effective', I mean that wearing this mask cuts in half the chance that they'll infect a nearby susceptible person.
    </p>

  </div>

  <anim-with-caption :mask1="true" :mask2="false" :eout="0.5"><b>Transmission Route 2:</b> If the contagious person wears a 50% effective mask,<br/>disease transmission is reduced by 50%.</anim-with-caption>

  <div class="container">

    <p>But what if instead the susceptible person is the one wearing the mask?</p>

    <p>
      In general, the effectiveness of a mask varies depending on whether you’re <b>inhaling</b> or <b>exhaling</b> through it.
      For the moment, let’s keep things simple and assume that this mask is equally effective in both directions.
    </p>

    <p>In that case, if the susceptible person wears this mask whenever they're near a contagious person, their chance of infection will also drop by 50%.</p>

  </div>

  <anim-with-caption :mask1="false" :mask2="true" :ein="0.5"><b>Transmission Route 3:</b> If the susceptible person wears a 50% effective mask,<br/>disease transmission is also reduced by 50%.</anim-with-caption>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>What if both the contagious <i>and</i> the susceptible person wear a mask?</p> 

    <p>
      Well, the first mask filters the air the contagious person breathes <b>out</b>, which cuts the chance of infection in half.
      The second mask filters the air the susceptible person breathes <b>in</b>, which again cuts the chance of infection in half.
    </p>

    <p>
      So when <i>both</i> people are wearing masks the chance of infection is quartered (as compared to when neither of them wear masks).
      That's a 75% reduction in the risk of infection.
    </p>

  </div>

  <anim-with-caption :mask1="true" :mask2="true" :eout="0.5" :ein="0.5"><b>Transmission Route 4:</b> When both people wear 50% effective masks,<br/>disease transmission is reduced by 75%.</anim-with-caption>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>
      If you think about it, it's surprising that a 50% effective mask can potentially reduce the risk of infection by 75%.
      This is possible because when both people wear masks, the mouth spray is filtered twice: once on the way out, and a second time on the way in.
      This <b>double protection</b> makes masks much more effective than you might intuitively expect.
    </p>

    <p>So here again are all four possible routes through which an airborne disease can spread from person to person.</p>

    <h2>From People to The Population</h2>

    <p>
      So far, we've been looking at the transmission of disease in the context of two people.
      But how do we go from understanding disease transmission between two people to understanding disease transmission in the <i>entire population</i>?
    </p> 

    <p>Well, in the extreme limits, this is straightforward.</p> 

    <p>For example, if <b>nobody</b> wore a mask, we’d only have the first route to consider, and so disease transmission in the population would be unaffected.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    <div class="graphic-container">

      <div class="row big-small-small">
        <div class="column onehundredpx">

        If nobody wore a mask, disease transmission would be unaffected.
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container">

    <p>
      Conversely, suppose <b>everybody</b> wore a mask.
      In this route, whenever two people meet, they'd both be wearing masks.
      So we’d only have the last route to consider.
      And if each mask were 50% effective, then disease transmission in the overall population would drop by 75 percent.
    </p>

  <div class="container">

    <p>
      In reality, some people wear masks and others don’t.
      This implies that the virus can spread through all four possible routes.
      Each route has a different likelihood and a different level of risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      When either 0% or 100% of people wear masks, it's straightforward to calculate the benefit that masks provide.
      The question is, how do we do calculate this in general?
    <p>

    <p>Let's try a simple case. Suppose that 50% of people wear masks.</p>

    <p>
      When two people meet at random, the chance that both people are wearing masks is the chance that the first person is wearing a mask multiplied by the chance that the second person is wearing a mask.
      So the chance that both people are wearing masks when in close contact is 50% times 50%, i.e. 25%.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, you can work out the likelihood of the other three routes.
      It turns out that when half the population wears masks, each route is equally likely.
      (Can you convince yourself why this has to be true?)

  <div class="container">

    <p>
      We can now calculate the average drop in disease transmission in the entire population.
      This involves averaging all four possible routes.
      Since we’ve set things up so that each route is equally likely, this is just the average of 0%, 50%, 50% and 75%, which is 43.75%.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, people who don’t wear masks can only get infected via the first two routes shown above, which are equally likely when half the population is wearing a mask.
      So the drop in disease transmission to mask-wearers is the average of 0% and 50%, which is 25%.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, people who <i>do</i> wear masks can only get infected via the last two routes shown above.
      So the drop in disease transmission to mask-wearers is the average of 50% and 75%, which is 62.5%.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    <div class="graphic-container">
      <div class="column">
        <div class="splash">Average Drop in Disease Transmission = 43.75%</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>
      So mask-wearers get the largest benefit from masks (no surprise there).
      But even non-mask wearers get a modest benefit, by freeloading off other people who wear masks.
      That’s because the air that they inhale is often filtered by <i>other people’s</i> partially effective masks (shown above in the second route.)
    </p>

    <p>The population as a whole, which is made up of both mask-wearers and non-mask wearers, gets a benefit somewhere in between these two groups.</p>

    <p>So in this simplified example (where 50% of people wear 50% effective masks), we’ve worked out how to go from the <b>protection that a mask offers an <i>individual</i></b> to the <b>collective benefit that masks confer to <i>society</i>.</b></p>

    <h2>Maskology</h2>

    <p>
      Let's apply this logic to <i>any values</i> of <b>mask wearership</b> and <b>mask effectiveness</b>.
      Vary the sliders below to see how masks influence the spread of disease.

      What happens to disease transmission if 50% of people wear a 50% effective mask?
      Or 60% wear a 60% effective mask?
      Or 70% wear a 70% effective mask?
      The interactive above lets you easily predict the answer to these questions.
    </p>

    <p>The conclusion: <b>When more people wear masks, everyone is safer.</b></p>

    <p>
      By filtering exhaled air, masks protect both mask-wearers and non-mask wearers alike.
      And by filtering inhaled air, masks provide additional protection to those who wear them.
      As mask wearing increases, the spread of disease reduces for <b>everyone</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, masks are even more effective than this calculation suggests.
    </p>

    <h2>How To Stop An Epidemic</h2>

    <p>
      You extinguish a fire by starving it of oxygen. 
      But you don't need to remove all the oxygen, you just need to reduce it enough to stop the fire from spreading.
      It's the same with an epidemic — you don't need to cut disease transmission by 100%, you just need to reduce it enough to stop the disease from growing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You've probably heard of the epidemiology term R0, pronounced R-nought or R-zero.
      This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number">the number of people that a contagious person can infect</a> in a population with no prior immunity to the disease.
    </p> 

    <p>When R0 is greater than 1, the disease will grow exponentially until we reach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">herd immunity</a>, which happens either when sufficiently many people get vaccinated, or get infected and develop immunity to the disease.</p>

    <p>
      But, as Ed Yong writes in the Atlantic, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/">"R0 is not destiny"</a>.
      R0 is a product of two numbers: the average number of people that a contagious person encounters, and the chance of infection upon contact.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="graphic">
    <div class="graphic-container">
      <div class="column">
        <div class="splash">R0 = average number of people that a contagious person encounters <br/>⨉ probability of infection upon contact </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container">

    <p>
      Social distancing, quarantines, and lockdowns reduce the first number.
      And wearing masks reduces the second number.
      The goal of all these strategies is to bring the epidemic under control by pulling R0 beneath 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this in mind, let's express the impact of masks in terms of R0.
      The graph below shows how R0 varies as mask wearing increases.
      You can use the slider to vary R0, which for COVID-19 is between 2 and 3 (in the absence of other public health measures such as social distancing.)
      And you can also vary how effective these masks are.

  <div class="container">

    <p>
      To stop the spread of COVID-19, we need to bring R0 beneath 1 (and keep it there).
      So how many people need to wear a 50% effective mask in order to stop the spread of COVID-19?
      What if the masks are 60% effective?
      Or 70% effective?
    </p>

    <p>
      With this interactive, you can predict the answer to these questions.
      (In reality, because people tend to cluster together and not mix randomly, the numbers this model predicts will be an underestimate.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We can take this one step further.
      R0 is an abstract quantity to think about, and it would be nice if we could express this in more relatable, human terms.

    <h2>The Human Cost</h2>

    <p>Masks save lives by reducing the chance of infection which, in turn, shrinks the extent of the epidemic.</p>

    <p>This suggests that we can get a clearer picture of the human cost of not wearing masks if, instead of visualizing R0, we visualize the infected fraction of the population under different mask-wearing scenarios.</p>

    <p>By using a widely-used mathematical model of epidemics known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">SIR model</a>, we can relate R0 to the fraction of people who will eventually be infected.</p>
    
    <p>Although this model is a considerable simplification of reality (e.g. it assumes random mixing between people and no lockdowns), it can offer us a ballpark estimate of the human cost of not wearing masks.</p>

      This hill-shaped curve shows us how masks influence the number of people who will be infected in an epidemic.
      To end the spread of COVID-19, we need to get to the bottom of this hill.
    </p>

    <p>
      When very few people wear masks, we're at the top of the hill.
      And since the top of the hill has a shallow slope, this means that, at first, wearing masks provides a modest drop in the number of infections.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as more people wear masks, we move further down the hill, and the hill grows steeper. 
      Every step to the right moves us further downwards.
      Which means masks provide greater returns as more people wear them.
    </p>

    <p>
      When enough people wear masks, we get to the bottom of the hill, and the risk of infection drops to zero.
      This is how masks can end an epidemic.
      But masks can only end an epidemic if enough people wear them.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might wonder how many people have to wear masks to end an epidemic.
      This depends on how effective the mask is.
      By playing with interactive above, you can see that if masks were 100% effective, you'd need a little over a third of the population to wear them to stop the spread of COVID-19.
      But if masks are 50% effective, you'd need closer to three-quarters of the population to wear them to stop the spread.
    </p>

    <p>
      We all want to get to the bottom of the hill and end this epidemic.
      But you can't get there by yourself.
      Each person can only take a tiny step downwards.
      However, when many people take this small step, together, we take a giant leap down the hill.
    </p>

    <p>Together, we can get to the bottom of the hill.</p>
    
    <p>Together, we can end COVID-19.</p>
